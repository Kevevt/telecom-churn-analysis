# 📊 Telecom Customer Churn Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying the key drivers behind customer attrition (churn) for a Telecommunications company. Using **Python** and **Machine Learning**, I analyzed a dataset of 7,043 customers to provide actionable insights that help reduce the current **26.5% churn rate**.

This analysis was developed as part of the **Oracle Next Education (ONE)** program in collaboration with Alura Latam.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.13
* **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
* **Environment:** Jupyter Notebook / VS Code
* **Methodology:** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Decision Tree Classification

## 🔍 Key Findings
* **The "6-Month Cliff":** Most Fiber Optic customers who churn do so within their first **6 months** of service.
* **Contract Power:** Month-to-month contracts are the #1 predictor of churn. There is a strong negative correlation (**-0.40**) between contract duration and attrition.
* **Service Friction:** Fiber Optic users coupled with Electronic Check payments represent the highest risk segment.

## 📈 Visualizations
The project includes several advanced visualizations to support the business case:
1. **Waffle Chart:** Global churn distribution.
2. **Feature Importance:** Mathematical ranking of variables impacting churn.
3. **Density/Histogram Analysis:** Temporal distribution of customer loss.
4. **Correlation Heatmap:** Statistical relationships between service variables.

## 🚀 Strategic Recommendations
1. **Contract Migration:** Implement incentives to move "Month-to-Month" users to 1 or 2-year plans.
2. **Onboarding Program:** Design a 180-day "VIP Onboarding" for Fiber Optic users to mitigate early-stage churn.
3. **Payment Optimization:** Promote automated credit card payments over electronic checks to reduce friction.
